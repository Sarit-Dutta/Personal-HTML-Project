                <h2>Music</h2>
                <p>
                    Music is essentially my primary hobby outside of gaming as it has been an integral part of my life
                    since childhood. Starting from age 6, my parents had me enrolled in a musical observatory where I 
                    learnt to play the piano and climbed up the levels within the Royal Conversatory of Music until I 
                    reached Level 8 where I decided to stop classes in favour of studying. However, even through the 
                    reduced practice times for piano, I found other ways to integrate music in my life, such as Youtube,
                    or Spotify for example. Channels such as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/kylelandry">Kyle Landry</a>,
                    and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/Animenzzz">Animenz</a> who incorporated their skill in
                    the musical arts and tied them to musical themes and motifs from films, television shows and video games
                    which I had seen or played whilst growing up. It also exposed me to the rapper known as Watsky, whose
                    first song I had heard as part of a web animated series made by Rooster Teeth. His artistic talents
                    and visually imaginative lyrics brought a whole other sense of ease and sometimes melancholy to the world
                    around me which kept me grounded, and I still listen to his music today, having only recently realizing
                    the evolution he went through over the past 3 to 4 years, from his album 
                    <a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/4kxbcsTJEJYfxYV0QuAR9T?si=dal12FcbSn-WWnpJ9RDEag">Cardboard Castles</a>,
                    up until his most recent album <a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/1YzsUujBhYJX3zmgqYTCLs?si=5R6cZKtEQ8GtNDk7fXLjzA">
                    Placement</a>. My favourite set by him however is known as xInfinity, which I will place within below
                    for your leisure:

                An additional set of hyperlinks here in the situation that an individual scrolls down to the bottom
                so that scrolling to return to the header nav section isn't necessary.

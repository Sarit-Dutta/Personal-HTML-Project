                <p id="music-intro">
                    Music is essentially my primary hobby outside of gaming as it has been an integral part of my life
                    since childhood. Starting from age 6, my parents had me enrolled in a musical observatory where I 
                    learnt to play the piano and climbed up the levels within the Royal Conversatory of Music until I 
                    reached Level 8 where I decided to stop classes in favour of studying. However, even through the 
                    reduced practice times for piano, I found other ways to integrate music in my life, such as Youtube,
                    or Spotify for example. Channels such as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/kylelandry">Kyle Landry</a>,
                    and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/Animenzzz">Animenz</a> who incorporated their skill in
                    the musical arts and tied them to musical themes and motifs from films, television shows and video games
                    which I had seen or played whilst growing up. It also exposed me to the rapper known as Watsky, whose
                    first song I had heard as part of a web animated series made by Rooster Teeth. His artistic talents
                    and visually imaginative lyrics brought a whole other sense of ease and sometimes melancholy to the world
                    around me which kept me grounded, and I still listen to his music today, having only recently realizing
                    the evolution he went through over the past 3 to 4 years, from his album 
                    <a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/4kxbcsTJEJYfxYV0QuAR9T?si=dal12FcbSn-WWnpJ9RDEag">Cardboard Castles</a>,
                    up until his most recent album <a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/1YzsUujBhYJX3zmgqYTCLs?si=5R6cZKtEQ8GtNDk7fXLjzA">
                    Placement</a>. My favourite set by him however is known as xInfinity, whose sample I will place below
                    for your leisure:

                <div class="description">
                    xInfinity was Watsky's 6th album and took his lyrical poetry in a different direction then it had previously.
                    This resulted in a variety of different songs such as Chemical Angel, and Roses whose three arcs close out
                    the album. And near the end of the third act you hear the same traffic sounds that start of Tiny Little Screens
                    Part 3 at the beginning of the album resulting in a loop that will be maintained xInfinity times.

                    Gaming has been an intricate part of my life for a long time, and like most I've been parttaking in this hobby
                    since childhood. It started off with minor things like playing solitaire and hearts on the old windows computers
                    but there was a game on one of the PCs back at my elementary school which was what people consider to be a bullet
                    hell game these days. It was essentially a space shooter where the goal was to make it to the end of the three stages 
                    to fight the boss, but getting there was the most difficult part as there were swarms of enemies diving straight at you
                    or filling the screen with projectiles to dodge with only a limited time to identify the space between and scamper through
                    and this was quite difficult for me and my friends to attempt at the time as it was an experience unlike any that we
                    had experienced in the past. From there one I branched out to online flash games on sites like Newgrounds, Armor Games
                    and etcetera for some time before I was able to try out the N64 Mario Kart at my cousin's place (truly a classic) and
                    that was what finally pulled me into the realm that I balance out with work and other activities on the side.
